In 1961, the beginning of March, I was at perhaps the highest point
of my academic career. I had just returned from being a visiting
professor at the University of California at Berkeley: I had been
assured of a permanent post that was being held for me at Harvard,
if I got my publications in order. I held appointments in four
departments at Harvardâ€”the Social Relations Department, the
Psychology Department, the Graduate School of Education, and the
Health Service (where I was a therapist); I had research contracts
with Yale and Stanford. In a worldly sense, I was making a great
income and I was a collector of possessions.I had an apartment in
Cambridge that was filled with antiques and I gave very charming
dinner parties: I had a Mercedes-Benz sedan and a Triumph 500 CC
motorcycle and a Cessna 172 airplane and an MG sports car and a
sailboat and a bicycle. IT vacationed in the Caribbean where I did
scuba-diving. | TEXT
